## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
```
Error: 401 Incorrect API key provided
```
**Solution**: Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.

#### Port Conflicts
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000
```
**Solution**: Change the PORT in your `.env` file or kill existing processes:
```bash
pkill -f "node server.js"
```

#### Database Issues
**Solution**: Reset the database by deleting `reddit_analytics.db` and restarting:
```bash
rm reddit_analytics.db
npm start
```

#### Memory Issues
**Solution**: For high-volume usage, increase Node.js memory limit:
```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 server.js
```

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm start
```

Check application logs:
```bash
# Docker
docker-compose logs -f

# Local
npm start | tee logs.txt
```

## Performance & Scaling

### Current Limits

- **Data Collection**: 25 posts per hour (600 posts/day)
- **API Calls**: Rate-limited by OpenAI quota
- **Storage**: SQLite suitable for < 100K posts
- **Concurrent Users**: Designed for < 100 simultaneous users

### Scaling Considerations

For high-volume usage:

1. **Database**: Migrate to PostgreSQL for better concurrent access
2. **Caching**: Add Redis for API response caching
3. **Load Balancing**: Use multiple application instances
4. **API Limits**: Implement request queuing for OpenAI calls

---

## Security

### Best Practices

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

### Compliance

- **Data Privacy**: No personal customer data is stored
- **GDPR**: All data is anonymized Reddit posts
- **SOC 2**: Compatible with enterprise security requirements
